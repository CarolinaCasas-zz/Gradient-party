            Gradients allow you—the designer—to explore new opportunities to provide fresh, clean designs for your audience. The added transition between colors allows you to play with two-dimensional and seemingly three-dimensional aspects, taking your designs from boring to extraordinary with some simple code.

            <p>
                In fact, the best thing about gradient code is that it can be as simple or as complex as you’d like to make it. You can do the bare minimum and let the browser figure out the rest, or you can take things into your own hands and identify all the odds and ends. You could even do a little extra if you wanted and explore the endless possibilities of gradients.
